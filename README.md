  ### Launching a bot instance for a configuration
  #### IMPORTANT : NEVER USE YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT TO AVOID GETTING BANNED
  #### *Always create a new wallet, login with it and email verify it on the axie marketplace, transfer only the WETH for the axies you want to buy, + the 4% fee*

  ### After launching an instance, Botaxie will keep filtering the latest axies listed, until it finds a match, and will buy it for you.
  #### You can monitor the instance's progress and logs from the Instances page
